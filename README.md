# Hi, I'm Cyrus :) 
(he / him)</br>
I'm a 4th year software engineering student at the University of Alberta. I'm currently looking for internship oppurtunities for Summer and Fall 2021. </br>

I'm currently working on and learning more about full-stack web development, iOS app development, and more. Stay tuned as I continue to build projects (check out my project portfolio [website](cyrusdiego.com)) </br>
